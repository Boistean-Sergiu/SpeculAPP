        This strategy game is a money-exchange simulator that encourages the player to make risky moves thanks to its randomness.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        SpeculAPP is a pseudo-strategy game which tests the player's wits in his attempt to make a fortune using the money he is given. And, being a game made by romaninans in this case, the RON valute has the role of gold.

        Client-side: a client/user on our website will be able to do the following:
		<ul>
            <li>Login and/or register - as a basic function of any game, wanting to have unique players, to not steal highscores or the like.</li>
            <li>Play - being a game, this is what users want to do after the login.</li>
            <li>Salute - as a little joke, at the press of a button, the game will say hello to the player.</li>
            <li>See the top 10 players, always - either to keep the pressure on, or just for curiosity, the RSS news feed will always be there for the player, showing in real time the top 10.</li>
		</ul>
		And by using:
		<ul>
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
            <li>PHP</li>

        <p>
          Being a simple project, we didn't feel the need to use any project style, there being nothing so hard that it needed special care. Nothing but PHP, something gotta do something about this programming language.

        <h3>Source-code management</h3>
		
        <p>
          We used Github as a Version Control System, simply because it was easier to share between teammates than facebook.

        <h3>Building</h3>
        <p>
          At the beginning, there was chaos. Coding in PHP proved to be not as simple as we imagined, and being unable to use frameworks and playing it safe and not use any external library but the ones built-in, we had to figure out how to make all the function in a crude and sloppy way.

	<section id="conclusions">
      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <p>
		As a conclusion to this project finalisation, we are glad to say that we now know what it is like to code in PHP, and do NOT want to repeat the experience...ever. Javascript or whatever framework exists, much better. I prefer coding in clips!
